# LiquidKit 
[![Build Status](https://app.bitrise.io/app/6afbf32de8b1c32d/status.svg?token=da5CE9nSJWjGt1xWE4OkkA&branch=master)](https://app.bitrise.io/app/6afbf32de8b1c32d)

Liquid template language parser engine in Swift.

## About

Liquid is a template language that is used by several projects, such as Shopify and Jekyll (which powers GitHub pages). Liquid allows conditional injection of content into html pages through a simple and elegant syntax.

LiquidKit brings the power of Liquid to iOS and macOS. It is currently under development, so not all features are available.

This project is based on the [liquid-swift](https://github.com/yourtion/liquid-swift) project by [yourtion](https://github.com/yourtion), which provided a barebones implementation of the Lexer and the Parser. However, it was lacking any implementation of Tags, Filters, and everything else, which I have added. It has been renamed and re-hosted since I intend to maintain this project myself.
